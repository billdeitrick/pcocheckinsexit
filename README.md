# PCO Check-ins Exit

This is a simple Arduino script that turns an Arduino device into an exit "key" for [PCO](http://planning.center) Check-ins kiosks. Basically, this turns the device into a keyboard emulator that will simulate the CTRL + ALT + ENTER sequence when plugged into a USB port. This is useful for Windows devices without an external keyboard that have also had the on-screen keyboard disabled. Inspired (and some code shamelessly swiped from) the "[Centipede](https://labs.amplifiedit.com/centipede/)" project from Amplified Labs.

Worked with an [Arduino Pro Micro](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012FOV17O/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B012FOV17O&linkCode=as2&tag=ampit01-20&linkId=f088280a53c7896a06d4dc3479ae4526).
